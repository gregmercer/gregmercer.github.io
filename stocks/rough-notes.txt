Industry Attractiveness 
This first Foolish criterion measures the attractiveness of the industry in which a company operates. An industry's potential, its challenges, and its characteristics, including the quality of its sales (for example, how high are average gross profits on every dollar of revenue for the industry?) all figure in our rating of this criterion. This criterion is rated one to four jester caps based on an industry's long-term growth potential, its viability, its average or potential profitability, the ability for a company in the industry to expand its business, and so forth. You want to invest in companies that, above all, operate in extremely attractive and, if not profitable, then soon-to-be-profitable, growing industries. This criterion helps you to determine which companies are in the most promising industries for investors.

Position in Industry 
Once you've found an attractive industry in which to invest, the next important step is to find a company that is very well positioned within that industry. This rating helps you to weed out the third-tier players in an industry, because Position in Industry measures where a company stands in its industry. As Fools, we typically like to invest in only the leading one or two top companies in an industry, nothing less. Is it the top dog, leading the pack (with the highest sales growth, market share, mindshare, and so forth)? Or is it a mere follower? Only true industry leaders (if not outright dominators) are granted the highest rating.

Business Quality 
Once you've found a strong industry and a leading company in that industry, you still need to make certain that the company has a high-quality business. Our Business Quality rating addresses the economics and management behind a business, including its profitability, its growth avenues and future opportunities; its competitive position; its management's experience, expertise, and history; and much more. How profitable can a business become? What is the potential long-term return on investment for the business? Can the assets of the business eventually be leveraged into new growth opportunities? Does the company have sustainable competitive advantages? Business quality is arguably much more important than valuation concerns for a long-term investor. The quality of a business drives the cash flow-generating capacity, which ultimately controls the stock price. This rating (and our report's coinciding analysis) helps you to spot and learn about the highest-quality businesses listed on the stock market.

Investment Predictability 
Investment Predictability takes into account the stability of a business in order to help you determine the risk that you may, or may not, face. Older, mature businesses with steady, predictable streams of cash flow (specifically, operating and net earnings) will be rated much higher in predictability than will young, sporadic, and volatile companies, the future earnings of which are difficult to predict, thereby increasing your risks. Investment Predictability essentially encapsulates all the qualities presented in our first three Foolish criteria, and then tells us how likely it is that a certain investment outcome will occur.

Overall Prospects 
Probably the most self-explanatory of our Foolish criteria, Overall Prospects wraps up the whole enchilada, from industry attractiveness to a company's business quality and competitive position, from management to a company's valuation on the stock market. All of this and more combines to create an Overall Prospects rating for the company. Essentially, the conclusion derived from the full report on the company goes into this final rating. The higher the rating, the more attractive we believe the investment.

Notes from 'How to Read A Financial Report' John A. Tracy

Sales Revenue / Accts Receivable = x times
52 weeks / x times = y weeks (to turn Accts Receivable into Cash)

example:
10.4m Sales Revenue / 1m Accts Receivable = 10.4 times
52 weeks / 10.4 times = 5 weeks

Cost of Goods Sold Expense / Inventory = x times
52 weeks / x times = y weeks (number of weeks to sell inventory) <-- (a*)

Inventory / Accts Payable = x times
Number weeks to Sell Inventory / x times = y weeks (number of weeks before inventory paid)

example:
1.690m Inventory / 520k Accts Payable - Inventory = 3.25 times
6.760m Cost of Goods Sold Expense / 1.690 Inventory = 4 times
52 weeks / 4 times = 13 weeks (number of weeks to sell inventory)
13 weeks / 3.25 times = 4 (number of weeks before inventory paid)
so… this tells us the first 4 weeks of the 13 are 'free ride' to the company and only paid after the 4th week, the remaining 9 weeks need to be financed.

Operating Expenses / Prepaid Expenses = x times
52 weeks / x times = y weeks (Prepaid Expenses balance is y weeks of annual Operating Expenses)

Operating Expenses / Accrued Operating Expenses = x times
52 weeks / x times = y weeks (Accrued Operating Expenses
 balance is y weeks of annual Operating Expenses)

Current Ratio:
Current Assets / Current Liabilities (general rule should be 2 to 1 or higher to be safe)

Acid Test (Quick Ratio):
Cash + Accts Receivable / Current Liabilites  (general rule should be 1 to 1 or higher to be safe)

Debt To Equity Ratio:
Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity  (general rule stay below 1 to 1)

Times Interest Earned Ratio:
Operating Earnings / Interest Expense (should be higher than 1 to 1)

Return on Sales:
Net Income / Sales Revenue

Return on Equity:
Net Income / Total Shareholders' Equity ( NI / SE see next few lines )

Leverage = Total Assets / Total Shareholders' Equity
Turn = Sales Revenue / Total Assets
Margin = Net Income / Sales Revenue

ROE = Leverage x Turn x Margin
ROE = (TA / SE) x (SR / TA) x (NI / SR)
ROE = NI / SE

Return on Assets:
Operating Earnings / Total Assets

Earnings Per Share:
Net Income / Outstanding Common Shares

By: John Del Vecchio; Tom Jacobs

Other Financial Formulas:

Days Sales Outstanding (DSO):
DSO = 91.25 * (accounts receiveable / quarterly revenue) 

Days in Deferred Revenue (DDR):
DDR = 91.25 * (deferred revenue / quarterly revenue)

Relationship between DSO and DDR:
DSO - DDR is bad if this is increasing (meaning less deferred revenue, and more credit extended to customers).

Relationship between Accounts Receiveable(A/R) and Revenue:
Bad if A/R is very high as a percent of Revenue

Days Sales in Inventory (DSI):
DSI = 91.25 * (inventory / quarterly cost of goods sold)

Boosting Earnings:

If management lengthens the depreciation and amortization (D&A) period, it reduces operating expenses, boosting EPS.

If the percentage of allowance for doubtful accounts drops sharply relative to gross accounts receivable, it may indicate an artificial boost to revenues and, therefore, earnings.

If goodwill and intangibles are large as a percentage of total assets, it could mean that assets are overvalued due to acquisitions.

Book Notes: 
"Wealth Secrets of the One Percent," - Wilkin

“Seven Secrets of Spectacularly Rich People.” I suspect several of these might draw a rude comment from F. Ross Johnson.

Secret No. 1: “Don’t be the best. Be the only.” Here Wilkin tells the story of the Thurn and Taxis European postal monopoly and how it crushed a potential rival in the 17th century. “Growth isn’t the ultimate achievement of business strategy,” he writes. “Having one’s competitors hanged is the ultimate achievement of business strategy.”

Secret No. 2: “Bigger is still better.” In this section Wilkin concludes that monopolies and economies of scale are wonderful ways to make money. Well, yes.

Secret No. 3: “The worst place to do business is really the best.” In other words, it’s easier to make big money in countries with corrupt regimes, such as post-­Soviet, ’90s-era Russia, or in a fledgling third-world country. “It is much better to go for a large share of a tiny market,” he writes. “There, you can turn the screws.” Memo to Wharton grads: Somalia now open for business!

Secret No. 4: “When lenders can’t lose, you win.” This summarizes a section in which Wilkin retells the familiar story of how too-big-to-fail banks get bailed out.

Secret No. 5: “You’ve got to own it, baby, own it.” It’s good to own property. My father told me this when I was 9. I’m sure Schopenhauer’s did as well.

Secret No. 6: “Spin laws into gold.” On the importance of creating helpful laws, especially those too complex for others to fully understand.

Secret No. 7: “If you want to succeed in business, network, network, network.” Wherever possible, control all related networks, such as supply and transportation.
